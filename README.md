# Gotoken
A combination of centralised application and set of smart contracts
More of the information is present after entering the `eth_project`

App is under testing phase.

I have used *Iterative Waterfall model* for development of the project.
Based upon the assignment ,I generated the required documentation. After that I designed the entire pathway.
The steps follwed by me were:

  o Documentation[Assignment]
  
  o Design[Smart contract + app cli interaction]
  
  o Code[Golang app + smart contract]
  
  o Testing[Using Ginkgo framework]
  
 After each phase the entire code developed so far was tested foe different conditions like location of packages and version
  differences.
